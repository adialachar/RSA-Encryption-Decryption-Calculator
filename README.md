### RSA Encryption / Decryption Calculator


Date Written: 7/11/18

Last Update: 7/20/18



This is a webpage that can calculate the value either to *be* encrypted (Encryption Calculator) or the value that *is* encrypted (Decryption Calculator)

The back-end of the webpage is done using the Flask framework and is written in Python. The front-end is written in HTML/CSS.


## Installation

In the future, I would like to docker-ize the program so that it will not matter whether you have python installed on your machine to use my program, but for now the installation is as follows:


1. git pull https://github.com/adialachar/RSA-Encryption-Decryption-Calculator.git


2. execute the statment "python app.py"


## Future work


In the future I would like to 


1. Docker-ize the program so that it can be run from anywhere

2. Connect the application to a PostgreSQL database and Docker-ize the database

3. Improve the look of the website using tools like JavaScript, AJAX, and jQuery
